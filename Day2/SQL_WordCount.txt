Sample Word Count

A] Create a file called sample in /home/notroot/lab/data folder and copy the same in HDFS via the –copyFromLocal statement.

B] This is the word count logic in DF.

val df = sqlContext.read.text("/input/sample")
df.show(10,truncate=false)

Next split each of the line in to words using the split function. This will create a new DataFrame with words column, each words column would have array of words for that line.

val wordsDF = df.select(split(df("value")," ").alias("words")) 
Note here the value is the default column name.

wordsDF.show(10,truncate=false)

Next use explode transformation to convert the words array in to a data frame with word as the column name. This is like the FlatMap() method on RDD

val wordDF = wordsDF.select(explode(wordsDF("words")).alias("word"))
wordDF.show(10,truncate=false)

Next you have the DF with each line containing singe word in the file. So group the Data Frame based on word and count the occurrence of each word

val wordCountDF = wordDF.groupBy("word").count
wordCountDF.show(truncate=false)

This is to find out the top 20 top most words in the file
wordCountDF.orderBy(desc("count")).show(truncate=false)
